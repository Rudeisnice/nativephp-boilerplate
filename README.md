# NativePHP Boilerplate

This Boilerplate is your starting point for a NativePHP project.

## Prerequisites/Recommendations

Native on Windows/Mac/Linux

- Laravel Herd (Mac/Windows) (optional but recommended)
- PHP, Composer and NPM installed if not using Laravel Herd

On Windows with WSL ()

- PHP & Composer on host for first install
- Docker Desktop (optional)
- WSL Distribution (Tested with Ubuntu 22.04)
- Docker on WSL (if not using Docker Desktop)

## Installation

Create a template from this or git clone it.

`git clone https://github.com/Rudeisnice/nativephp-boilerplate.git`

### Native install

install Laravel dependencies and build the docker image.

`composer install && npm install`

### WSL Specific

WSL uses Laravel sail for ease of use.

`composer install && sail build --no-cache && sail up -d && sail npm install`

### Finishing touches

Run composer post install scripts

Native:

`composer run post-root-package-install && composer run post-create-project-cmd`

Sail:

`sail composer run post-root-package-install && sail composer run post-create-project-cmd`


## Usage

Modified sail container with Wine for cross-building to Windows target.<br>
Use `sail` instead of `php` for building.

### Serving for Development

Use `php artisan native:serve` for serving the dev application.

### Building

Building on Windows with mounted WSL takes >20 mins. Its recommended to build directly on the WSL Distro. Without mounting, build time is cut down to roughly 2 mins (i7 9700KF for reference). Depending on your application.

`sail artisan native:build win`

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
